# hello-world

This is an experimental repository I am using as I try to learn to use github

I am hoping to use/find/write a script that will help me to import Evernote files into Scrivener. 

I think that I have found a script that will change Evernote files into text files.

After that I plan to import those text files to Scrivener.
